<h2><img src = "avatarsymbol.png" id = "symbol"> &nbsp; Synopsis</h2>
<p>
This film, set many years into the future, stars a titular paraplegic character named Jake Sully as he is offered to participate 
in a corporate scientific program where his mind/consciousness will be temporarily transferred into 
the body of an artificially created alien host body called an Avatar. He then travels to a far distant planet 
called Pandora where he is greeted by a mischievous military group called the RDA and his grumpy yet well-meaning 
handler/leader of the scientific program Grace Augustine. With his new avatar body Jake has the ability to walk 
again and then goes on a long tumultuous journey where he tries to gain the trust of the native alien species his avatar 
is based of off called the Navi , falls in love, and wages war with the villainous RDA military while struggling to cope with his identity.

<h2>Review</h2>
<p>
This film is one of my favorite movies of all time because whenever I think about the movie or see images or clips from the movie 
it brings me back to a simpler time in my life when 
I was just a kid. I remember watching the film for the first time and getting immersed in this world that James Cameron created. 
I thought that the visual effects were stunning and they still hold up to this 
day for a film that came out in 2009. I really enjoyed the action and the drama in the film.
It still amazes me how revolutionary this film was at the time in terms of special effects, animation, and 3-D film watching. It also amazes me how this film ended up being one of the 
highest grossing box office films of all time.
